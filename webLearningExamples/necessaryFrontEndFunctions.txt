This is a list of all the necessary functions on the front end.

All of the mentions below are me figuring out how to handle each task, there should be a filename after anything that is marked 'done' and this file is an example of how to complete each task.

Drag and drop data file:
-Handle ndimensional array data (javascript)
-Store array in browser memory 
-Load data array from file (javascript)
    --> html5 example https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_files_from_web_applications
-Read file handle object given by user
    --> example of drag and drop file reading https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Using_files_from_web_applications


Present data to user in an interactable table:
- (done) show data in table. (html / js) - showDataTable.*
- (done) make an editable table. (js) - showDataTable.js
-make column elements movable. 
    -> redips ex http://www.redips.net/my/preview/REDIPS_drag/example01/
    -> html5 (use this one) ex http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_draganddrop.asp

Plot the data:
-make a plot of a data set (plot.ly)
-show blank plot
-plot data that is dragged to respective axis.
    -> you might make a box below the axis label that receives the data from the user.
